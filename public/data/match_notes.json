Since with 10-15 seconds of setup for home pu and 45-50 seconds of total PU it's only half the time that we're attacking in a non-pu situation. So do normal 2+2 until pu and then 3+1 with pu. we should also consider delaying our own pu too mid game or something, if we're leading to sync the pu back up.",
